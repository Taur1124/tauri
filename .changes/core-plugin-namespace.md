Core plugin permissions are now prefixed with `core:`, the `core:default` permission set can now be used and the `core` plugin name is reserved.
The `tauri migrate` tool will automate the migration process, which involves prefixing all `app`, `event`, `image`, `menu`, `path`, `resources`, `tray`, `webview` and `window` permissions with `core:`.
