# go-bindings

This is a placeholder for the forthcoming golang bindings. We have frozen development on this so we can focus on shipping the Rust version of Tauri, but we welcome PRs. 

There is a lot to do, including mapping the full API, bridge implementation etc. Please take a look at `/lib/rust/src/` for insight into the work required to make a new binding.

> Do not file issues about Go unless you mention that you intend to contribute. They will be closed immediately, with a meme of our choosing.
