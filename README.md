**Proton** brings a mode to build Quasar Apps that creates tiny, blazing 
fast binaries for all major desktop platforms. In Quasar's 
[neverending quest](https://quasar.dev/introduction-to-quasar#Why-Quasar%3F) 
for performance and security, the core team is proud to offer an
alternative to Electron.

Whether you are just starting out making apps for your meetup or 
regularly crunch terabyte datasets, we are absolutely confident that 
you will love using Proton as much as we love making and maintaining it.

## Who Proton is For
Anyone who can create a Quasar app can use Proton, as it is *merely* a new 
build target. All components and plugins (suitable for Native Desktop) can
be used. For the User Interface, nothing has changed, except you will 
probably notice that everything seems much faster.

Because of the way Proton has been built and can be extended, developers 
are able to interface not only with the entire Rust ecosystem, but also 
with many other programming languages. Being freed of the heaviest thing 
in the universe and the many shortcomings of server-side Javascript 
suddenly opens up whole new avenues for high-performance, security-focused
applications that need the purebred power, agility and community 
acceptance of a low-level language.

We expect to witness an entire new class of applications being built with 
Quasar Proton. From a simple calender to locally crunching massive realtime 
feeds at particle colliders or even mesh-network based distributed message-
passing ecosystems - the bar has been raised and gauntlet thrown. 

What will you make?

## Technical Details
The user interface in Proton apps currently leverages Cocoa/WebKit on macOS, 
gtk-webkit2 on Linux and MSHTML (IE10/11) or Webkit via Edge on Windows. 
**Proton** is based on the MIT licensed prior work known as 
[webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview).

The default binding to the underlying webview library currently uses Rust,
but other languages like Golang or Python (and many others) are possible 
(and only a PR away).

> Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage 
collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded 
devices, and easily integrate with other languages. Rust’s rich type system
and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — and enable
you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time. Rust has great 
documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch
tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor
support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and 
more. - [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

This combination of power, safety and usability are why we chose Rust to be
the default binding for Proton. It is our intention to provide the most safe
and performant native app experience (for devs and app consumers), out of 
the box.

### Current Status
We are in the process of vetting this new mode. It is not yet available to
use without jumping through some development hurdles. If you don't care,
please reach out to the team at https://chat.quasar.dev and we'll guide
you through the process. Here is a bit of a status report.

- [x] Promise based File System Access
- [x] App Icons and integration with Icon-Genie
- [ ] Frameless Mode
- [x] Build on MacOS
- [x] Build on Linux
- [ ] Build on Windows
- [x] STDOUT Passthrough with Command Invocation
- [x]  Self Updater
- [x]  Inter Process Communication (IPC)
- [x]  Documentation

## Relation to Upstream Origins
We have made the decision to fork, enhance and maintain several upstream
projects here in this repository, in order to guarantee the security of the
code and our ability to enhance it with features that may not be needed for
other consumers.

We hope that this code is useful, but make no claims to suitability or 
guarantees that it will work outside of the Quasar ecosystem.

This has been done with our best attempt at due diligence and in
respect of the original authors. Thankyou - this project would never have
been possible without your amazing contribution to open-source and we are
honoured to carry the torch further. Of special note:
- [zserge](https://github.com/zserge) for the original webview approach and 
go bindings
- [Boscop](https://github.com/Boscop) for the Rust Bindings
